Description: xTAPP: first-principles plane-wave pseudo-potential code
  xTAPP is a first-principles plane-wave pseudo-potential code. It computes band structure and electronic states with high precision for a wide range of materials including metals, oxide surfaces, solid interfaces, and so forth. It has support tools and visualization of output and input, is available as a massively parallel computer using OpenMP, MPI, and GPGPU.
